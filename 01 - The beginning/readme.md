# The Beginning
Let me just start saying, I am a big nerd. No really. When I was a teen, about two decades ago already, I always was facinated with technology. For example, when I saw the internals of a television set, video recorder or the motor of a car for that matter, I always wondered how it worked. What I saw was a piece of art to me. Especially with small electronics like mechanical video recorders for example [Video2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2yTWGZPwtw), [U-Matic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmWEJC7TVbc), [Betamax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwk_dLQ0ChY), [VHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04J8lReE9O8), CD players [LaserDisc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04J8lReE9O8), or a [car engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjeB_JUbK0). When you see all the levers, motors, belts and electronics work perfectly together, controlling the mechanics and even fault correcting errors on the tape in perfect timing all based on mathematics and physics, I was hooked on the sciences, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that I ended up having a bachelor degree in both electronics and software engineering. 

## Robotics
I like sci-fi and a key player in sci-fi are robots. Robots help humans to do things that our human bodies cannot, or when we think there is too much risk for ourselves. Robots come in all forms and sizes and fall in different categories. The exo-skeleton where we as a human take place in it and control the big robot. Bio-mechanical, enhance parts of our bodies like replacing a missing limb with a mechanical one that are being controlled by our human brain. Remote controlled mechanical robots like the [mars rover](http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/) that, based on instructions from earth can autonomicly drive from point A to B and there are many others. 

## Tinkering with robots
Working our way up to tinkering with robots is a great way to (re)-learn electronics, mechanics and along the way brush up on our math. Its a great time to start tinkering because the level to entry is very low.

## What you'll need
To start tinkering, you'll need the following:

* [Basic learning kit for Arduino](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kuman-Basic-Learning-Starter-Arduino/dp/B018SCTG6A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1464107031&sr=8-2&keywords=basic+learning+kit+for+arduino) that contains the Arduino microcontroller, some basic materials and electronics. 
* A volt / ampere meter,
* Batteries


Beside that I've bought:

* [Makeblock Uno Shield](http://makeblock.com/me-uno-shield), to connect Arduino UNO with ]Makeblock electronic modules. 
* [Makeblock 7 segment display](http://makeblock.com/me-7-segment-serial-display-red)
* [Makeblock LED matrix 8x16](http://makeblock.com/me-led-matrix-8-16)
* [Makeblock light sensor](http://makeblock.com/me-light-sensor)
* [Makeblock sound sensor](http://makeblock.com/me-sound-sensor)
* [Makeblock temperature and humidity sensor](http://makeblock.com/me-temperature-and-humidity-sensor)

## Makeblock
To start out with mechanics and electronics, most people don't have much experience with both and to become sufficiently experienced working with mechanics and electronics can be daunting. Not to say about the initial investment buying the tools necessary for creating frames, wheels or knowing what parts to use and how to wire it all together on a printed circuit board. 

When you just start out, [Makeblock](http://makeblock.com/) makes it easy for you to start tinkering with mechanics and electronics. They have created a standard way to start constructing by standardizing the mechanics and the electronics. Just take a look at their [mechanical parts](http://makeblock.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=69) and [electronic modules](http://makeblock.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=59) offering and you'll get an idea what I mean. 

To be honest, after some time maybe you want to start tinkering with mechanics and/or electronics for yourself, but by then you'll found out if you like tinkering with robots and/or automating things eg. creating a smart-lamp! 

I have bought some mechanics (basic robot kits) and electronics to get going fast! And IMHO its not that expensive. Disclosure: I have *no* affiliation with Makeblock what so ever! 

See you in '02 - Makeblock Shield'!

Have fun!
